# TCTCodeRepository
The repository is structured like this:
- Folders are for specific topics (tooltips, endings, CYOA...) 
- Folders might contain subfolders
- Each folder contains the necessary Javascript and CSS (if needed). The CSS is wrapped inside some Javascript to add it (since in TCT modding, that's the way to do it). Instead of adding multiple CSS stylesheets, you can instead just add one stylesheet with all the CSS

All the code here can be used in your mods, with or without credit. If you want to credit, please just put in a link to this site, to help other modders find it.

This project is maintained by me (Nina), but I'm happy if other people want to contribute!
